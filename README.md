# PlanMyTrip 🗺️ ✈️
A full stack travel planning application developed in React. 

This application lets you create cards representing your trips, including location, dates of stay and a map. <br />
The number of days is automatically calculated according to the selected dates.  <br />
Clicking on a trip card takes you to a page dedicated to managing activities specific to that trip.  <br />
You can easily add activities in real time and organize them by day, thanks to drag-and-drop functionality.
